<h1>គោលការណ៍ភាពឯកជន</h1>
<p>We, at Ganzberg, care deeply about privacy. We believe in transparency, and we're committed to being upfront about our privacy practices, including how we treat your personal information. We know you care about your privacy too, so we provide settings that allow you to choose how certain information is used by Ganzberg. This policy explains our privacy practices for store.ganzberg.com and our other services provided by Ganzberg (we'll refer to store.ganzberg.com collectively as the "Site" and our other services as the "Services.").</p>
<h3>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h3>

<p>To use the Services, you will need to provide valid phone number and email address. Depending on the Services that you choose to use, we may collect additional information, for example: information in private channels like conversations, a telephone number, and a physical address. Please note that for security and performance reasons, such content may need to be accessed by certain Ganzberg personnel from time to time.</p>

<p>The name associated with your Ganzberg account is publicly displayed and connected to your Ganzberg activities. You may review and change that name through your account settings. Other people may see the date you joined; ratings, reviews and related photos for items you purchased or sold; your profile information; items you listed for sale; your store pages and policies; your favorites, followers and those you follow; sold item listings and the number of items sold; and comments you post in our community spaces. You may optionally choose to provide and publicly display your full name and other personal information (such as birthday, gender, and location).</p>

<p>You may connect to the Services with an external application, in which case Ganzberg may receive information from that other service, as explained below. We use technologies such as cookies, clear gifs, and log files for several purposes, including to help understand how you interact with the Site and the Services, in order to provide a better experience, and for marketing and advertising. For more information about cookies, mobile analytics, and similar technologies.</p>

<p>Ganzberg and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users' movements around the Site, including across devices, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on the Site or through the Services.</p>

<h3>USES AND SHARING</h3>

<p>We use the information that we gather from you in a number of ways. For example, if you purchase an item, we'll share your delivery information with the seller; we use data analytics and work with certain third-party service providers to ensure site functionality, to improve the Services, and for targeted online and offline advertising and marketing; and of course, we use your phone or email address to communicate with you. We also partner with service providers and other third parties that collect, use, promote, and analyze information about Ganzberg members and visitors.</p>

<p>Ganzberg will not sell or disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent, except as specified in our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>CHOICES AND CONTROL</h3>

<p>You may review and change your information in your account settings, and you may remove certain optional pieces of information. You may also control the receipt of certain types of communications from Ganzberg in your account settings. We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.</p>

<h3>COOKIES</h3>
<p>Generally, we use cookies to identify you and enable us to (i) access your Registration Information or Account Information so you do not have to re-enter it; (ii) gather statistical information about usage by users; (iii) research visiting patterns and help target advertisements based on user interests; (iv) assist our partners to track user visits to the Sites and process orders; and (v) track progress and participation in promotions.</p>

<p>You can determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring the browser which is installed in the computer or smart phone you are using to access the Sites. If you choose, you can change those configurations. By setting your preferences in the browser, you can accept all cookies or you can choose to be notified when a cookie is sent or you can choose to reject all cookies. If you reject all cookies by choosing the cookie-disabling function in your browser, you may be required to re-enter information on the Sites more often and certain features of the Sites may be unavailable.</p>

<h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p>Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated by us posting an amended and restated Privacy Policy on the Sites. Once posted on the Sites the new Privacy Policy will be effective immediately. You agree that any information we hold about you (as described in this Privacy Policy and whether or not collected prior to or after the new Privacy Policy became effective) will be governed by the latest version of the Privacy Policy.</p>
